# Greetings from the author -
Welcome to a text based 'CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE' game. 

Written in Python, this game begins with you, as a player, waking up and making multiple choices throughtout the day.
Each choice will have its own consequence, so be smart and choose them wisely. 
After all, you are the one who has the free will to choose your own consequences, or do you? ;)

Thanks for visiting the page, and if you wish to make your own contribution in my pet project, feel free to do so. 
Just make it as amazing as you are! :)
